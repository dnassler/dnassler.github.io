  * [Experiment 1 - quickly flickering/shifting lines]({{site.url}}/p5/exp3d/index.html)
  * [Experiment 2 - pinch and rotate and swipe gestures]({{site.url}}/p5/exp4/index.html)
  * [Experiment 3 - waves at sea]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/expWave1/index.html)
  * [Experiment 4 - bubbles]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp3b/index.html)
  * [Experiment 5 - twirling, shifting structures]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp4/index.html)
  * [Experiment 6 - creaky doors]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp5/index.html)
  * [Experiment 7 - triangular patterns]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp6/index.html)
  * [Experiment 7b - repeated patterns with lines/boxes]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp6b/index.html)
  * [Experiment 8 - subway experience with sounds (abstract)]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp6b2/index.html)
  	* some sounds used were excerpts from the following:  Freesound.org - "Toronto Subway - Wellesley to Osgoode" by lonemonk, and Freesound.org - "Subway NY inside speaker door o-c" by beman87

  * [Experiment 9 - video image grid, changing]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp9/index.html)
  * [Experiment 9b - video image grid with marker, changing]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp9b/index.html)
  * [Experiment 11b - lines rotated controllable via mouse x-coordinate]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp11b/index.html)
  * [Experiment 11c - moon-like phases]({{site.url}}/p5/graphics-exp/exp11c/index.html)
